<H3>Horseback riding is a huge responsibility. It's important to be aware of everything that this sport entails before committing. You must arrive 30 minutes before your lesson to get your horse and then brush him off. Then, you need to put their tack on and take them out to the ring. After your lesson, you must clean the horse and tack. This activity is something that takes up a lot of your time, but it's definitely worth it. The bond you build with a horse is a feeling you will never feel with anything else. It's truly magical.</h3>
